      <h6>WELL HELLO THERE</h6>
      <h3 class="introduction">I am Marina Villarroel, a creative, architect and aspiring web developer based in London, UK.</h3>
      <p style="line-height: 2;">I have a passion for creativity, architectural design, and web design. I was born in Salamanca, Spain; but spent my young adulthood in Madrid where I studied Architecture. I migrated over to London in search of opportunities. This is not just a dynamic and amazing city, but also one that gives you so many options and different paths. All of my working life so far has been in London, and although I remain passionate about architecture and problem solving, I feel there is more to explore in the tech industry to fulfill my design focus and creativity. The pandemic has also made me reevaluate things and value flexibility and dynamism, which the construction world lacks. I started my coding world in Udemy and I have caught the coding bug; I would love the opportunity to keep learning with Founders and Coders.</p>

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="architecture" src="images/museum.png" alt="">
        <h3>Architecture Design</h3>
        <p class="description1">Currently working as an architect at the architecture and urban planning international practice Allies and Morrison in London
          where I have been involved in cutting edge projects such as the new BBC Studios at our budding Stratford East cultural hub
          where I am currently finalising Stage 4 and a new office development in Canada Water. <br>
          Previously I worked for four years at the Cambridge based architectural practise MCW Architects where I was involved as
          a fully qualified architect in several educational projects. <br>
          I have a keen interest in technological innovation to support the design process and is one of the reasons why I became one
          of the key people to implement the BIM system in MCW. This has given me an in-depth knowledge of Autodesk Revit. Outside
          of the office, I have been broadening my knowledge, trying out Dynamo and other software.</p>

        <img class="web" src="images/www.png" alt="">
        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p class="description2">As a very design focused person I like to keep it simple. My goals are to focus on typography, content and conveying the message that you want to send.</p>
