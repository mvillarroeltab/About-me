# About me

This is the repository for the FAC application, exercise number 5. The prompt is to create a webpage about yourself, introducing you as an individual and explaining why you are interested in the FAC application.

The website should:

- Tell us about you
- Talk about why you’d like to move into a career as a web developer
- Showcase what you’ve learnt so far

A few of the requirements are:
All code is written by you
No external libraries (e.g. no Bootstrap, React or GitHub Pages themes, but external fonts/icons are fine)
Tells us about who you are
Tells us about why you are applying for the programme
Shows your progress through the application projects (e.g. links to your deployed projects)
Hosted on GitHub Pages
Links back to the GitHub repository that contains the code for your site
To demonstrate your learning your site must have at least one example of each of these:

Semantic HTML5 elements
CSS grid or flexbox layout (or both)
DOM event listeners for user interaction (e.g. click, keydown)
DOM updates in response to user interaction (e.g. showing/hiding an element, changing text or styles)
