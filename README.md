# About me

This is the repository for the FAC application, exercise number 5. The prompt is to create a webpage about yourself, introducing you as an individual and explaining why you are interested in the FAC application.

## Application requirements

The website should:

- Tell us about you
- Talk about why you’d like to move into a career as a web developer
- Showcase what you’ve learnt so far

  Some requirements are:
    - All code is written by you
    - No external libraries (e.g. no Bootstrap, React or GitHub Pages themes, but external fonts/icons are fine)
    - Tells us about who you are
    - Tells us about why you are applying for the programme
    - Shows your progress through the application projects (e.g. links to your deployed projects)
    - Hosted on GitHub Pages
    - Links back to the GitHub repository that contains the code for your site
  To demonstrate your learning your site must have at least one example of each of these:

    - Semantic HTML5 elements
    - CSS grid or flexbox layout (or both)
    - DOM event listeners for user interaction (e.g. click, keydown)
    - DOM updates in response to user interaction (e.g. showing/hiding an element, changing text or styles)
    - 
## Implementation

This is a single page website that was written with HTML, CSS and Javascript only.
It uses CSS grid layout and CSS flex model for the visualitation and to make it responsive.

To meet the requirements, I wanted the website to have:
1. A fixed nav bar which would make it easy from a navigational point of view and which would also take you through the different sections and launch the feature of the website, which is initially hidden.
2. An image grid layout which would intrigue the user. All the images are about me
3. An 'about-me' section would follow, explaining some personal background and reasons to join FAC.
4. A 'what do I bring' section which would further illustrate why I am a good applicant.
5. A project section made responsive with flex to showcase my learnings.
6. A closing section on how to contact me.

some information about me and the reasons why I should join the Founders and Coders community. These were then made into three separate slides of a carousel.
